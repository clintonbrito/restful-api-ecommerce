### Accessing API Documentation

1. **Run the Application:**
   Make sure the application is running locally. Follow the [Getting Started](#-getting-started-locally) section for instructions on starting the application.

2. **Open XXXX UI:**
   Once the application is running, you can access the XXXX UI by navigating to the following URL in your web browser:

<pre><code>http://localhost:3333/api/v1/ui</code></pre>

3. **Explore Endpoints:**
   In the XXXX UI, you'll find a list of available endpoints along with details about request parameters, expected responses, and sample requests. Use this interface to understand how to interact with the API.

Feel free to explore and test the API directly from the XXXX UI. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the [Issues](https://github.com/clintonbrito/restful-api-ecommerce/issues) section for support.
