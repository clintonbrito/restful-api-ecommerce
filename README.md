# RESTful API E-Commerce Project

This is a MVP e-commerce-like API developed from scratch. It allows you to manage users, clients, products and sales. The project follows the MVC architecture and includes user authentication with JWT.

## üöÄ Getting started locally

<p style>Clone this repository to your local machine and access the cloned directory:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:clintonbrito/restful-api-ecommerce.git
cd restful-api-ecommerce</code></pre>

<p>Run this command to create all the project's Docker containers and install the dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>docker compose up -d --build</code></pre>

<p>If you need to stop and remove the project's Docker containers, you can use the following command:</p>

<pre><code>docker compose down</code></pre>

Check the docker logs using the command `docker logs -f app` which address is running the application and open your browser or any prefered API client in order to test the endpoints through the address below, for example:

<pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:3333</code></pre>

## üìñ API Documentation

Explore the API documentation to understand the available endpoints, request parameters, and responses. The documentation is built using [Bruno üê∂](https://www.usebruno.com/), a fast and Git-friendly Opensource API client, which also provides an interactive and user-friendly interface.

### Accessing API Documentation

1. **Run the Application:**
   Make sure the application is running locally. Follow the [Getting Started](#-getting-started-locally) section for instructions on starting the application.

2. **Feel free to give a try to Bruno and download it:**
   Check out the [Download](https://www.usebruno.com/downloads) page and follow the instructions.

3. **Open Bruno Desktop App:**
   Once the application Docker containers are running ok, you can access the Bruno Desktop App.

4. **Explore Endpoints:**
   In the Bruno Desktop App, you just need to import `/docs/Ecommerce API` collection folder and voil√†: you'll find a list of available endpoints along with details about request parameters. Use this interface to understand how to interact with the API. The base URL of the API which you should use as an environment variable on Bruno is the following:
   
   <pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:3333</code></pre>

Feel free to explore and test the API directly any other API client you prefer. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the [Issues](https://github.com/clintonbrito/restful-api-ecommerce/issues) section for support.

## üî≠ Future features

For future features, I intend to include:
1. Unit testing with a high code coverage;
2. Date filtering for sales;
3. Improve user authentication and authorization policy;
4. Use Auth as a middleware instead of manually checking JWT credentials;
5. Separate business logic in service layer;
6. Work on better DTOs;
7. Deploy the project on a cloud service.

## üé® Development Patterns

### Commit Patterns

[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-%23FE5196?logo=conventionalcommits&logoColor=white)](https://conventionalcommits.org)
<a href="https://gitmoji.dev">

    alt="Gitmoji"
  />
</a>

This project adopts [Gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji) and the commit convention known as [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This means that we follow a standardized format for our commit messages, making it easier to generate changelogs and adopt semantic versioning.

Example commit messages format:

<pre><code>feat: add login functionality
fix: resolve issue with user registration
wip: connecting back-end to front-end</code></pre>

### Branch Patterns

The branches in this project follow a specific pattern to facilitate organization and understanding of ongoing development. Some of the common prefixes used include `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`:

Example branch names:

<pre><code>feature/docker-setup
bugfix/eslint-errors
docs/update-readme</code></pre>
